        <p>
          Hello! I'm Lateef, a frontend developer passionate about crafting
          intuitive, responsive user interfaces that bring ideas to life. As I
          step into the next phase of my journey through this internship
          program, my goal is to deepen my understanding of scalable design
          systems, strengthen my collaboration within agile teams, and gain
          exposure to real-world product development cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
          While I’m confident in my ability to build clean, accessible layouts
          and work with modern frameworks like React and Tailwind CSS, I’m still
          growing in areas like debugging complex state logic and optimizing
          performance across devices. I see these as opportunities—not
          obstacles—and I’m committed to improving through mentorship, hands-on
          experience, and continuous learning.
        </p>

      <!-- Goals Section -->
      <section data-testid="test-about-goals">
        <h2>Goals in this Program</h2>
        <p>
          My primary goal in this HNG internship program centers on deepening my
          practical experience and expanding my technical toolkit. I aim to:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Strengthen my proficiency in modern frameworks like React and Vue
          </li>
          <li>
            Learn to collaborate effectively within cross-functional teams
          </li>
          <li>
            Gain exposure to real-world product lifecycles and agile workflows
          </li>
          <li>Improve my ability to write scalable, maintainable code</li>
          <li>
            Build confidence in debugging, performance optimization, and
            accessibility best practices
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          This internship is more than a learning opportunity — it’s a chance to
          contribute meaningfully, challenge myself, and grow into a developer
          who builds with empathy and precision.

        <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
        <p>
          As I continue developing my frontend skills, I’m actively working to
          improve in areas where I feel less confident:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Debugging complex state logic: I sometimes find it challenging to
            trace issues in deeply nested components or asynchronous flows.
          </li>
          <li>
            Performance optimization: I’m learning how to fine-tune rendering
            behavior and reduce load times, especially for mobile users.
          </li>
          <li>
            Accessibility (a11y): While I understand the basics, I want to
            deepen my knowledge to ensure inclusive design across all projects.
          </li>
          <li>
            Communicating technical decisions: I’m practicing how to explain my
            choices clearly to both technical and non-technical teammates.
          </li>
          <li>
            Design intuition: I’m building confidence in making UI decisions
            that balance aesthetics with usability.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          These aren’t weaknesses—they’re growth edges. I’m committed to turning
          each one into a strength through mentorship, hands-on experience, and
          continuous learning.

      <!-- Note to Future Self Section -->

        <h2>Note to Future Self</h2>
        <p>
          Remember to stay curious, embrace failures as learning opportunities,
          and never lose sight of your long-term goals. Your efforts now will
          shape your future success. Remember how far you've come. The late
          nights spent learning, the moments of doubt, and the breakthroughs
          that followed—they all shaped you. Keep asking questions, stay
          curious, and never lose sight of why you started: to build things that
          matter.

        <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
        <p>
          Reflecting regularly has helped me understand my strengths and
          weaknesses better. I aim to maintain this habit and continually adapt
          to new challenges. I believe growth happens at the edge of discomfort.
          This internship isn’t just a stepping stone—it’s a proving ground. I’m
          here to contribute, learn, and evolve. Let’s build something
          meaningful.
